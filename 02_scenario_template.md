### Signing up new players
Coach David likes to first meet with the new players who have decided they want to join the team.  Most of the time potential new players approach the coach between plays at the games. David directs them to the web application so they can sign up and register their details.  He then explains that once they have signed up and are in the system, he can then activate them as 'active players' - and they then have access to player only pages and information. 

### Who are we playing next

Bill is quite busy at work, but he likes to ensure that he is all prepared for the big game on the weekend. On his lunch break late in the week, Bill often checks the Team website for information relating to the next game.  He likes to know which team they are playing against next game, and what the expected weather condition's are projected to be - so he can take all the right gear.

### (What is the venue like)
### Priority 3
Sarah is generally quite prepared when attending games.  The team play every weekend, and sometimes at different locations.  Sarah likes to logon to the team website and find out where the next game is being played, specifically What the facilities are like at the venue.  She prefers home games, but if the game is not too far away she will attend.  She likes to know if she has to take lunch and a folding chair herself, rest rooms or whether the shade for the spectators.


### (Where are we playing?)
### Priority 2
Bill uses his navigation in his phone to help get directions to the game.  Bill loves the fact that the address for the next game is posted on the team website before each game.  The map next to the address on the team website also helps provide some context for the location and also a quick reference - so he can take a look at the surrounding area all from his phone.


### (Notifying just the players, and notify everyone)
### Priority 2
Being a coach, David sometimes has to motivate or notify just the team members.  David loves the convenience of being able to mark a notification as being 'private team notice' or 'general team notice' - that way he knows that his message to the team will only be read by either just the players or everyone.

### (Tracking team wins)
### Priority 3
Sarah follows the progress of the team quite closely.  Being able to logon to her teams website and track the progress of the teams achievements throughout the season is great.  She likes to know how many games have been won and lost, against whom, and by what score.

### (Am I getting stronger and faster?)
### Priority 3
Bill is a little obsessed with knowing that he is getting better at this sport.  The coach tracks key information about each players physical performance.  The information is recorded during training sessions, and updated into the team web application.  Bill likes to track how fast he can run, squat, bench press, and high high he can jump.  There is some healthy competition amongst the others players for top scores in each of those categories.

### (What positions are the players assigned to?)
### Priority 2
The coach spends a good amount of time deciding what positions the players will be set to for each game.  He likes to reward players who are committed to the team with the best opportunities, and that means the best positions - he also needs to balance that will talent, and demonstrated performance from previous games.  He likes to be able to select from the available players at any moment - and then provide the team and its supporters with the updated team position game table.  Being able to change this easily is really important, as sometimes some players are not able to make it to the game due to illness etc.
