# Application Concept Statement
I propose to build an application, call Team Manager, that will allow the coach of a Football team to easily update team players on key team updates, in a central formum.
The Application will aim to be a central hub where players can access current affairs relating to the team.
The application will also store key player metrics, rankings, and positions on the team.
The application will also serve as a general information service, for non players - essentially providing information relating to where games are being played and the player positions and profiles.

### Who are the intended users of the application
Coach and players of the team.
Non-players or support staff, and game attendees who want to support players.

### What
The application will provide general team information to non-players - location of games etc.
The application will allow the coach to manage and update key team performance metrics about the players and the team.
The application will provide a convenient central touch point for players to access team information.

### Why

The application aims to make supporting the team easier for non-players - easily being able to find out where the next game is being played, who they are playing against and what positions each player is currently assigned.
The application aims to make managing the team easier for the coach, simply being able to update the web application with core team performance metrics, including when and where games are being played - and general notifications to the team in one place.
The application aims to make being a player easier, and fun by accessing team notifications in once place, as well as tacking the teams and their own personal performance

### How
